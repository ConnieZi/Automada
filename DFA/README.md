# DFA
### Simulate the behavior of a Deterministic Finite Automata.<br/>
Run dfa.py with command line argument, which is a dfa file. <br/>
Example:
python3 dfa1.txt

Explanation:<br/>
1. dfa.txt: indicates how to draw out the DFA graph and provides example input strings to test the DFA.<br/>
2. Output: the program will write output to standard output (to the console) with a sequence consist of <code>Reject</code> and <code>Accept</code> based on the input strings (included in dfa.txt files) we feed it.
